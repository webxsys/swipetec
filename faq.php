      <ul class="faq-list"><li >What are merchant accounts?</li>
        <li>Merchant accounts are a type of bank account that allows you to accept credit card transactions. They manage the financial exchange from your customers' credit cards to your bank account.</li>


        <li>How soon can I start accepting credit cards?</li>
        <li>Once you've submitted the application, you'll be swiping credit cards within 1-2 business days.</li>


        <li>Which credit cards can I accept?</li>
        <li>Swipe Tec gives your business the ability to accept all major credit cards including Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express and JCB. American Express requires separate approval.</li>

        <li>How will I receive my funds?</li>
        <li>Each credit card payment will be directly deposited into the checking account of your choice, specified on your application.</li>

        <li>When will I receive my funds?</li>
        <li>It will take 24 hours for transactions to deposit into your specified checking account. Please ask us how you qualify for next day funding.</li>

        <li>Does my merchant account have a pre-approved processing limit?</li>
        <li>Each account is approved on an actual or projected dollar revenue basis, represented in each application. Swipe Tec thus reserves the right to monitor account activity should the intake fluctuate significantly above or below the initial representation.</li>

        <li>Can I receive both a credit card processing terminal, as well as an internet payment gateway?</li>

        <li>Absolutely. We're committed to accommodating any and all of your credit card processing needs.</li>

        <li>What if I already have a credit card terminal? Can I use it to accept transactions through Swipe Tec?</li>
        <li>Generally most existing equipment can be reprogrammed for use with Swipe Tec - just ask us!</li>

        <li>What if I'm switching to Swipe Tec from another processor? When should I close my account with my current processor?</li>
        <li>Once your new account is completely setup and processing transactions successfully with Swipe Tec, you may close your account with your other processor.</li>

        <li>What does AVS stand for?</li>
        <li>AVS is the Address Verification Service. The AVS helps prevent fraud in non-personal credit card transactions (Internet, Mail/Phone Order, etc.) by verifying the cardholder's billing address. Currently the AVS is only available for transactions made within the United States.</li>

        <li>Do I have to sign a contract?</li>
        <li>All new accounts require a 3-year service agreement.</li>
      </ul>
